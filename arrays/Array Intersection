Given two random integer arrays of size m and n, print their intersection. That is, print all the elements that are present in both the given arrays.
Input arrays can contain duplicate elements.



#include<climits>
void intersection(int input1[], int input2[], int size1, int size2) {
    /* Don't write main().
     * Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
     * Print the output and don't return it.
     * Taking input is handled automatically.
     */
for(int i=0;i<size1;i++){
        for(int j=0;j<size2;j++){
            if(input1[i]==input2[j]){
             cout << input1[i] << endl;
                input2[j]= INT_MIN;
                break;
            }
        }
        
}

}
