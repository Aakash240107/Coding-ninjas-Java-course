Given an array of integers of size n which contains numbers from 0 to n - 2. Each number is present at least once. That is, if n = 5, numbers from 0 to 3 is present in the given array at least once and one number is present twice. You need to find and return that duplicate number present in the array.
Assume, duplicate number is always present in the array.




class Solution {
       public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int fastPointer = 0, slowPointer = 0;
        
		// Phase 1: Try to make them meet each other
    do
        {
            fastPointer = nums[nums[fastPointer]];
            slowPointer = nums[slowPointer];
        }
        while (fastPointer != slowPointer);
        
	// Phase 2: Bring the slow pointer to the start and make them move over 1 by 1
        
           slowPointer = 0;
        while (slowPointer != fastPointer) {
            slowPointer = nums[slowPointer];
            fastPointer = nums[fastPointer];
        }
        
        return slowPointer;
    }

}
