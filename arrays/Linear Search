Given a random integer array A and an element x. You need to search this element x in the given array using linear search. Return the index of element in the input.
Linear search means, we need to compare elements from the array A one by one with the element x, till we found the match or we reach the end of array. If match found, return its index, and if not return -1.
Indexing in the array starts from 0.
Input format :
Line 1 : Integer n, Array Size
Line 2 : Array elements (separated by space)
Line 3 : Element to be searched (i.e. x)
Constraints :
1 <= n <= 10^5




public class LinearSearch{	
	
	public static int linearSearch(int[] arr, int num){
		/* Your class should be named LinearSearch
		 * Don't write main().
		 * Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
		 * Return output and don't print it.
	 	 * Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.

    int c, n;
   n=arr.length;
  
    for (c = 0; c < n; c++)
    {
      if (arr[c] == num)     /* Searching element is present */
      {
        
          return c;
      }
   }
    
   return -1; /* Element to search isn't present */

  }
