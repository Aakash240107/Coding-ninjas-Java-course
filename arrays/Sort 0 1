You are given an integer array A that contains only integers 0 and 1. Write a function to sort this array. Find a solution which scans the array only once. Don't use extra array.
You need to change in the given array itself. So no need to return or print anything.




public class SortBinaryArray{	

	public static void sortBinaryArray(int[] arr){
		/* Your class should be named SortBinaryArray.
		 * Don't write main().
     		 * Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
     		 * Update in the given array itself. Don't return or print anything.
     		 * Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.
                 */

  int j=0;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
        if(arr[i]==0){
        int temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
        j++;
        }
        }
    }
}
